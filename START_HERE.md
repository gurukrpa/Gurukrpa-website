# 🚀 One-Click Setup Guide

## What I've Created For You

I've created **automated setup scripts** that will handle everything once Node.js is installed!

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Clicks!)

### **Step 1: Install Node.js** (One-time, 5 minutes)

**Option A: Direct Download**
1. Click this link: https://nodejs.org/
2. Click the **green "LTS" button** (recommended version)
3. Run the downloaded file
4. Click "Next" → "Next" → "Install"
5. **Restart your computer** (important!)

**Option B: Using Winget (if you have it)**
```powershell
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```
Then restart computer.

---

### **Step 2: Run Setup Script** (Automatic!)

After restarting, **double-click one of these files** in your project folder:

**Option A (Recommended):**
📄 **`setup.bat`** - Just double-click, it does everything!

**Option B:**
📄 **`setup.ps1`** - PowerShell version (right-click → Run with PowerShell)

The script will automatically:
- ✅ Check Node.js installation
- ✅ Install all dependencies
- ✅ Show you next steps

---

### **Step 3: Setup Database** (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com
2. Click on project: **yavokvrcskbxhotpcejo**
3. Click **"SQL Editor"** in left menu
4. Click **"New Query"**
5. Open file: **`supabase/schema.sql`** from your project
6. Copy all the SQL code
7. Paste in Supabase SQL Editor
8. Click **"Run"** button
9. Done! ✅

---

### **Step 4: Start Your Website!**

**Option A: Double-click to start**
📄 **`start-dev.bat`** - I'll create this next!

**Option B: Use terminal**
```powershell
npm run dev
```

Then open: **http://localhost:3000**

## 📁 Scripts I Created

| File | What It Does | How to Use |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| `setup.bat` | Installs everything automatically | Double-click |
| `setup.ps1` | PowerShell version of setup | Right-click → Run |
| `start-dev.bat` | Starts the website | Double-click |

---

## 🎯 Complete Automation Flow

```
1. Install Node.js (one-time)
   ↓
2. Restart computer
   ↓
3. Double-click setup.bat
   ↓ (automatic installation)
4. Setup Supabase database (2 min)
   ↓
5. Double-click start-dev.bat

6. Website opens in browser! 🎉
```

## ❓ What If Something Goes Wrong?

### "setup.bat says Node.js not installed"
→ You need to restart your computer after installing Node.js

### "npm command not found"
→ Node.js installation didn't complete. Reinstall Node.js

### "Permission denied"
→ Right-click setup.ps1 → "Run as Administrator"

### "Port 3000 already in use"
→ Close any other development servers

## 🆘 Super Simple Alternative

If scripts don't work, just follow these 4 commands:

```powershell

cd "C:\Users\asus\Desktop\gurukrpa website"

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start website
npm run dev

# 4. Open browser to http://localhost:3000
```
